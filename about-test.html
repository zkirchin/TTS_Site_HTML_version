          <h4>An Atlanta native, Richard spent the first several years of his career in technology working with Cvent, a SaaS company based in Washington, DC. During his four years there, Cvent raised a hefty investment, rolled out new products, and experienced massive growth, ultimately leading to an IPO. Swept up in the excitement, Richard caught the tech bug (big time) and hasn’t looked back since! Following his time at Cvent, Richard worked with an early stage startup called HighGround based in Chicago. After helping to raise an initial investment round, the next step was naturally...to hire developers and build the product! With that, Richard stumbled into the world of web development and his hunger for learning to “code” was born. Looking to take his skills to the next level, Richard enrolled in an immersive web development program in Chicago, met Betsy, and the rest is history. As the only two southerners in the program, they bonded over their love for code, startups, and their mutual desire to put the South on the map as the next great tech hub.</h4>

Her efforts culminated with a merger with product development giant Enventys. After the merger, Betsy decided to get back to her entrepreneurial roots and left for Chicago to learn to code in an immersive program (where she met Richard Simms, the only other Southerner). Together, they decided to launch their own series of bootcamps and started TTS to bring tech instruction to and grow talent in the South. Betsy has served (or currently serves) as a Founders' Institute Mentor, Charlotte Venture Challenge Judge, Charlotte Global Shapers Mentor, and Speaker for Startup Weekend. When Betsy isn't busy with TTS, she can be found at local brewery runs, dominating her awesome husband (or really anyone for that matter) in foosball, and playing with her two favorite mutts, Coney & Lil 'Wheezy.</h4>

While maintaining her design firm, she also worked a couple days a week for Apple, Inc as a trainer and facilitator for over 2 years.

In her free time, she (…. wait, what is free time??) loves to see live music, attending sporting events, exploring all Raleigh has to offer (especially Movie Nights at Bittersweet and hitting up Bida Manda for their pork belly soup), and of course making the mecca home to Charleston all the dang time. </h4>
