    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <div class="span7 about-text-box">
      <p>The story of Tech Talent South starts with two southerners meeting halfway across the country in the windy city of Chicago. Hailing from Charlotte, NC, Betsy Hauser Idilbi had just sold off her Charlotte-based physical product development company and was looking for her next adventure. An Atlanta, GA native, Richard Simms was riding the entrepreneurial roller coster working with a Chicago-based early stage tech startup. Coincidently, both Betsy and Richard had hit a point where they realized they needed to learn to "code." For Betsy, with her background in helping entrepreneurs build physical products and launch companies, the exciting world of tech and the low cost of starting web-based businesses was too hard to resist. As Richard worked with developers to get a SaaS product built from scratch, he began to recognize the necessity of being able to talk the talk, prototype ideas, and understand how products were built.</p>
      <p>So, the two enrolled in some programming classes in Chicago, determined to master this empowering skill of coding. As the only two southerners in the class and with a shared passion for startups and all things tech, Betsy and Richard quickly became friends. Seeing the tremendous positive impact "coding bootcamps" were having, developing more technical talent and empowering entrepreneurs in places like California and New York, the two couldn't help but ask "Why the heck don't these opportunities exist in the South?" As they say, the rest is history. Betsy and Richard set out on a mission to bring tech education back home and to fuel growth and innovation in the South.</p>
      <p>With TTS's core "Code Immersion Programs," students are taken through an intensive but beginner-friendly 8-weeks learning a number of programming languages such as Ruby on Rails, HTML/CSS, Javascript, and AJAX. The goal? To go from beginner to being able to code and deploy dynamic web applications and to have a blast in the process. With networking opportunities, guest speakers, labs and company tours students are given ample opportunities to build valuable connections in the local tech community.</p>
      <p>Today, the TTS team and impact has grown by leaps and bounds, unified in the mission to develop more tech talent in the South and empower folks on a mission to do something BIG. After finding success in its initial markets, TTS has continued to set its sights on city after city in the South where it feels it can have a positive impact on the tech community and do its part to fuel innovation. With hundreds of alumni throughout the South, TTS has graduates working as developers, starting companies, pouring their hearts into local startups, publishing apps to the Apple app store, and more. By developing much-needed tech talent from the ground up, TTS believes that over time the value and impact of its programs will only continue to grow.</p>

          <h4>Before launching Tech Talent South, Betsy successfully ran Little Idea, a Charlotte-based, physical product development company. Her efforts culminated with a merger with product development giant Enventys. After the merger, Betsy decided to get back to her entrepreneurial roots and left for Chicago to learn to code in an immersive program (where she met Richard Simms, the only other Southerner). Together, they decided to launch their own series of bootcamps and started TTS to bring tech instruction to and grow talent in the South. Betsy has served (or currently serves) as a Founders' Institute Mentor, Charlotte Venture Challenge Judge, Charlotte Global Shapers Mentor, and Speaker for Startup Weekend. When Betsy isn't busy with TTS, she can be found at local brewery runs, dominating her awesome husband (or really anyone for that matter) in foosball, and playing with her two favorite mutts, Coney & Lil 'Wheezy.</h4>

During his four years there, Cvent raised a hefty investment, rolled out new products, and experienced massive growth, ultimately leading to an IPO. Swept up in the excitement, Richard caught the tech bug (big time) and hasn’t looked back since! Following his time at Cvent, Richard worked with an early stage startup called HighGround based in Chicago. After helping to raise an initial investment round, the next step was naturally...to hire developers and build the product! With that, Richard stumbled into the world of web development and his hunger for learning to “code” was born. Looking to take his skills to the next level, Richard enrolled in an immersive web development program in Chicago, met Betsy, and the rest is history. As the only two southerners in the program, they bonded over their love for code, startups, and their mutual desire to put the South on the map as the next great tech hub.</h4>

                Colin originally hails from Albany, NY, but moved to New Orleans in 2002 due to a sudden distaste for miserable cold weather.  Living in NOLA ever since, he started his career out of college as a marketer, but eventually decided to make a shift into web development.  For three years while working in marketing, he spent his nights and weekends hunched over endless books and tutorials, often forgetting to eat dinner.  In 2010 he began a freelancing career building websites for local small businesses.  In 2013, he was picked up at Loyola University New Orleans as a front-end developer, specializing in responsive design.  In 2014 he left Loyola for GE Capital, where he currently works as front-end developer.  He speaks front-end languages, PHP, Ruby, and a pinch of Python.  If you ever need something from him, bring cake.  He ranks Stars in the following order: Battle, Trek, and Wars.
